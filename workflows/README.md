# Gemini CLI Workflows

This directory contains a collection of example workflows that demonstrate how to use the [Google Gemini CLI GitHub Action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli). These workflows are designed to be reusable and customizable for your own projects.

## Available Workflows

*   **[Issue Triage](./issue-triage)**: Automatically triage GitHub issues using Gemini. This workflow can be configured to run on a schedule or be triggered by issue events.
*   **[Pull Request Review](./pr-review)**: Automatically review pull requests using Gemini. This workflow can be triggered by pull request events and provides a comprehensive review of the changes.
*   **[Gemini CLI](./gemini-cli)**: A general-purpose, conversational AI assistant that can be invoked within pull requests and issues to perform a wide range of tasks.
