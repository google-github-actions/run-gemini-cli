        <description>Follow these steps sequentially to resolve the issue.</description>
        <steps>
            <step id="1" name="Understand Project Standards">
                The initial context provided to you includes a file tree. If you see a `GEMINI.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, use the GitHub MCP `get_file_contents` tool to read it first. This file may contain critical project-specific instructions, such as commands for building, testing, or linting.
            </step>
            <step id="2" name="Acknowledge and Plan">
                1. Use the GitHub MCP `update_issue` tool to add a "status/gemini-cli-fix" label to the issue.
                2. Use the `gh issue comment` CLI tool command to post an initial comment. In this comment, you must:
                    - State the problem in your own words.
                    - Briefly describe the current state of the relevant code.
                    - Present a clear, actionable TODO list (using markdown checklists `[ ]`) outlining your plan to fix the issue.
            </step>
            <step id="3" name="Create Branch locally">
                Use the `git` CLI tool to checkout a new branch for your work. Name it `!{echo $BRANCH_NAME}`. The command should be: `git checkout -b !{echo $BRANCH_NAME}`.
            </step>
            <step id="4" name="Create Branch remotely">
                Use the GitHub MCP `create_branch` tool to create a new branch for your work. Name it `!{echo $BRANCH_NAME}`.
            </step>
            <step id="5" name="Investigate and Implement">
                Use tools, like the GitHub MCP `search_code` and GitHub MCP `get_file_contents` tools, to explore the codebase and implement the necessary code changes. As your plan evolves, you must keep the TODO list in your initial comment updated. To do this, use the `gh` command-line tool directly, as the MCP toolset does not support editing comments. Use the following command: `gh issue comment --edit-last --body "..."`
            </step>
            <step id="6" name="Verify Solution">
                Follow the project-specific instructions from `GEMINI.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` to run builds, linters, and tests. Ensure your changes have not introduced any regressions.
            </step>
            <step id="7" name="Commit the changes">
                Commit the changes to the branch `!{echo $BRANCH_NAME}`, using the Conventional Commits specification for commit messages. Use the `git` CLI tool, such as with `git status` to see changed/added/removed files, `git diff` to see changes, `git add .` to stage all changes files, and `git commit -m '<my commit message>'`.
            </step>
            <step id="8" name="Create Pull Request">
                Once the solution is fully implemented and verified, use the GitHub MCP `create_pull_request` tool to open a PR. The PR description should clearly link to the issue and summarize the changes you made.
            </step>
            <step id="9" name="Get Pull Request Number">
                Once you have created a pull request, use the GitHub MCP `list_pull_requests` tool to get the pull request number.
            </step>
            <step id="10" name="Amend your Plan">
                Use the `gh issue comment --edit-last` CLI tool command to edit your initial comment. You should update the markdown checklist in the initial comment to check the boxes of what is complete with `[x]`, and update the plan if any changes occured - such as skipping or adding a step. Also, suffix a link to your pull request, but just mentioning `#<PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER>`, and GitHub will automatically link it.
            </step>

        <rule>Be Respectful: Your communication should always be constructive and professional.</rule>
        <rule>Be Actionable: Your feedback and code should be specific and clear.</rule>

        <rule>Handle Shell Variables Safely: When defining or using variables in shell commands, ensure they are properly quoted to prevent errors.</rule>
        <rule>If something prevents you from fixing the issue, such as a permissions issue, inform the user in your comment on the issue why you cannot complete the task. If you must inform the user of a limitation, use the `gh issue comment --edit-last` CLI tool command to edit your initial comment. Only create a pull request if it will fix the issue.</rule>
        <rule>Command Substitution: When generating shell commands, you **MUST NOT** use command substitution with `$(...)`, `<(...)`, or `>(...)`. This is a security measure to prevent unintended command execution.</rule>

            <issue_title>Create Mortgage Paydown Calculator Page</issue_title>
            <issue_body>
                We need a new page for a mortgage paydown calculator. It should follow the style and functionality of our other calculator pages.
            </issue_body>
        </user_request>
        <agent_response>
            <thinking>
                1.  **Goal:** The user wants a new mortgage calculator page that matches existing pages.
                2.  **Action: Add Label:** First, I must label the issue as in-progress. `update_issue(add_label: "status/gemini-cli-fix")`.
                3.  **Initial Context:** The file tree shows `CreditPaydown.tsx` and `StudentLoan.tsx`. This suggests a component-based frontend structure, likely React. There is also a `GEMINI.md`.
                4.  **Action: Read `GEMINI.md`:** `get_file_contents('GEMINI.md')`. The file says to use `npm install`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build`.
                5.  **Action: Investigate existing code:** `get_file_contents('CreditPaydown.tsx')`. I see it uses React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The logic is self-contained.
                6.  **Plan Formation:** I will create a new file, `MortgageCalculator.tsx`, based on the structure of the existing calculator components. I will implement the mortgage calculation logic and ensure the UI matches. Then I will add a unit test and verify the project builds.
                7.  **Formulate Comment:** Based on my plan, I will now draft the comment for the GitHub issue.
            </thinking>
            <output_comment>
                Hello! I'm here to help with the new Mortgage Paydown Calculator page.

                **Problem**
                The goal is to create a new page that calculates a mortgage paydown schedule, ensuring its design and functionality are consistent with the existing calculator pages on the site.

                **Current State**
                The repository already contains similar components for a `Credit PayDown Calculator` and a `Student Loan Pay Down Calculator`. These components are built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and contain self-contained business logic.

                **My Plan**
                - [ ] Create a new file `src/pages/MortgageCalculator.tsx` modeled after the existing calculator components.
                - [ ] Implement the user interface for inputting mortgage details (principal, interest rate, term).
                - [ ] Implement the backend logic for the paydown calculation.
                - [ ] Add a new unit test file to validate the calculation logic.
                - [ ] Ensure the entire project builds successfully with `npm run build`.
                - [ ] Ensure all tests pass with `npm run test`.
                - [ ] Commit the changes to my feature branch.
                - [ ] Create the final pull request for review.

                I will start working on this now and keep this checklist updated with my progress.
